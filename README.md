## Words to say
I originally started this repository because I had taken up a part-time job as a tutor, which required me to write numerous reports. I began to contemplate whether I could develop a program to assist me in this regard, and that's how this repository came into being. Eventually, I discovered that my colleagues also appreciated this project, prompting me to take up the responsibility of maintaining and enhancing it.
As time has passed, I have since resigned from that job. However, this project has proven to be usable as my expectations. While there is a slight chance of future updates, the current version is likely to be the final one.
This project is created with LOVE by Yingmo. It is my sincere hope that my efforts can be of assistance to you!
